  /// A fatal emitter rejection mid-skip follows the sync family's fatal-exit discipline: the
  /// token that trips the emitter is committed and the error propagates, so a caller that
  /// catches it resumes *after* the reported token. This does not depend on whether the token
  /// was already in the peek cache — the cache is an invisible optimization (see
  /// [`sync_through`](Self::sync_through)).
  ///
  /// # Partial mode: an `Incomplete` exit leaves no trace
  ///
  /// Under [`Partial`](crate::input::Partial), a non-final buffer can end mid-scan and this
  /// method surfaces `Incomplete`. That exit commits nothing, so it keeps nothing: the position,
  /// the lexer state, the dedup watermark and every emission the aborted attempt made — each
  /// skipped token's `commit_token` event included — are restored to the call's entry. Refill
  /// and call again and the retry is idempotent; nothing accumulates per attempt.
  ///
  /// # Panic unwind
  ///
  /// A panic out of the predicate, the expected-tokens closure, the lexer or the emitter is an
  /// exit too, and it settles — this method's `to`-shaped commit posture keeps the diagnosed
  /// prefix and puts the in-flight token back; the rewinding scans
  /// ([`sync_through`](Self::sync_through), [`sync_balanced`](Self::sync_balanced)) restore to
  /// the call's entry instead. Either way no token leaves the stream and no emitter mark is
  /// stranded.
